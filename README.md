# AI Hallucination Spotter Game 🎯

## Basic Details
AI Hallucination Spotter is an interactive web-based educational game designed to improve users’ ability to detect misinformation generated by artificial intelligence systems.
The application presents users with short factual paragraphs containing one subtly incorrect or “hallucinated” sentence. The user’s task is to identify the false statement. After each attempt, the system provides instant feedback along with an explanation, helping users understand common patterns of AI hallucinations such as incorrect dates, wrong locations, fabricated statistics, or misattributed facts.
The platform aims to promote digital literacy and critical thinking by training users to evaluate AI-generated content rather than trusting it blindly.

### Project Description
Project Description
AI Hallucination Spotter is an interactive, web-based educational game designed to sharpen a user's ability to detect misinformation generated by Artificial Intelligence. In an era where generative AI is increasingly used for information gathering, this platform serves as a training ground for digital literacy and critical thinking.

The application presents users with short, factual paragraphs where one sentence is a "hallucination"—a statement that is subtly incorrect, misattributed, or entirely fabricated

### The Problem statement
As generative AI tools become widely used in education, research, and daily life, users increasingly rely on AI-generated content. However, AI systems can produce confident but incorrect information, known as hallucinations. Many users lack the skills to identify these inaccuracies, leading to misinformation spread and poor decision-making.

### The Solution
To define The Solution, you need to explain how your game moves a user from being a passive consumer of AI to an active, critical thinker. Since you are using a lightweight HTML/CSS/JS stack, the solution is focused on speed, accessibility, and immediate cognitive reinforcement.

The Solution
The AI Hallucination Spotter solves the problem of "AI over-reliance" by providing a controlled, gamified environment where users can fail safely while learning to identify misinformation. The solution is built on three strategic pillars:

1. Active Scrutiny over Passive Reading
Instead of just reading AI-generated text for information, users are tasked with "hunting" for an error. This shifts the brain into a critical-analytical mode, making them more likely to spot subtle inconsistencies like wrong dates or fabricated statistics that would otherwise be ignored.

2. Pattern Recognition Training
By categorizing hallucinations (e.g., Temporal, Logical, or Statistical), the game teaches users the "DNA" of AI errors. This allows them to build a mental framework for spotting similar "hallucination patterns" when using AI tools like ChatGPT or Gemini in their daily lives.

3. The Immediate Feedback Loop
The solution provides instant validation. When a user identifies (or misses) a hallucination, the system immediately reveals the Factual Truth and explains why the AI got it wrong. This converts a simple game into a high-impact educational tool.

## Technical Details

### Technologies/Components Used

**For Software:**
- Languages used: [e.g., html,css,js]
- Frameworks used: [e.g., JS]
- Libraries used: [e.g., JUnit]
- Tools used: [e.g., VS Code, Git]



## Features

Feature 1: Interactive "Sentence-Level" Scrubbing
The interface uses a custom JavaScript parser to break down AI-generated paragraphs into individual clickable elements. This allows users to pinpoint the exact moment an AI "hallucinates" rather than just guessing the general topic.

Feature 2: Categorized Hallucination Logic
The game doesn't just show "wrong" facts; it pulls from a structured JS dataset that classifies errors into types like Temporal Glitches (wrong dates), Statistical Fabrications (fake data), and Logic Loops. This helps users recognize the patterns of AI failure.

Feature 3: Instant "Truth-Card" Feedback
Using CSS transitions and JS event listeners, the app provides immediate visual feedback. Once a user clicks, a "Truth-Card" modal appears, revealing the verified factual source and explaining the specific nature of the AI's error.

Feature 4: Dynamic Session Randomization
To ensure replayability, the JavaScript engine uses a "Fisher-Yates Shuffle" algorithm on the dataset. Every time a user refreshes or starts a new round, the order of challenges changes, preventing memorization and forcing genuine critical thinking.

Feature 5: Performance Analytics Dashboard
A lightweight, browser-based scoring system tracks the user's "Detection Accuracy" and "Average Spotting Time." This gamified progress tracking motivates users to sharpen their skeptical eye over multiple sessions.
